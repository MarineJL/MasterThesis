# Master Thesis: How to predict the hit potential of a song?


Every week, thousands of songs are released on the market, but only a small fraction of those encounters great and popular success. Foster by the streaming platforms which revolutionized music consumption in less than a decade, the competition is harsh.

This master thesis aims at predicting the hit potential of a song. Based on data related to audio and meta contents exported from Spotify web API, I first focus on understanding how music has evolved over time and the analysis of the predictor variables. I then work on a classification problem, test and compare a set of algorithms depending on defined performance criteria to find the best model.
In this master thesis, I developed my own coding notebooks in both R and Python to perform ETL (extract, transform, load), text analysis and predictive modeling.

From the ever-changing business model, to the unprecedented influence of rap and hip-hop movements, this paper demonstrates that it is possible to successfully respond to listeners changing tastes, trends and innovation, using Data Science.
Being able to perform accurate predictions is a must at a time when music consumption relies on individual behaviors and recommendation systems.
